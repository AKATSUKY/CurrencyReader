# CurrencyReader
This code is an small Python API Consumer that every day reads the currencies value from CurrencyLayer, and stores it into my AWS MariaDB Database. Picture 1

It also demonstrates the results with a plot made in R, this Plot is an Line Chart with a few options for the user to filter and best view the data.

The Python API Consumer also is able to receive a parameter to load historical values. It reads all the currencies in the last 180 days. Picture 2.
